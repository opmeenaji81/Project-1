          <h2>Missile Man of India</h2>
          <p>
            <b>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam</b> 15 October 1931 â€“ 27 July
              2015) was an Indian aerospace scientist who served as the 11th
              president of India from 2002 to 2007. He was born and raised in
              Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace
              engineering. He spent the next four decades as a scientist and
              science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and
              Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research
              Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's civilian
              space programme and military missile development efforts.[1] He thus
              came to be known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the
              development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle
              technology.[2][3][4] He also played a pivotal organisational,
              technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in
              1998, the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.
